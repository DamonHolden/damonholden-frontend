# UOS DTS Degree Calculator

This React application was developed to allow students of the university of suffolk undergoing the Digital Technology Solutions apprenticeship degree to calculate their final degree based on their marks acquired throughout the course. Of course, this tool can also be used to work out what marks would need to be achieved in future modules to achieve a particular level of degree.

while I have tested that the calculation that this tool should make is correct, whether or not it reflects the University of Suffolk's calculation for the DTS degrees **is not** guaranteed. I have written the maths based on my **best knowledge** of how the DTS degrees are calculated. This is by no means a guaranteed of what your degree will/could be.

This tool is **unofficial**, so the University of Suffolk has no ties to this project at all, other than the fact I'm a current student. Anyone looking to get official support for their degree should seek a process facilitated by the University of Suffolk, not this tool.

while the source code for this project was written from scratch, the project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Following install of dependencies, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
